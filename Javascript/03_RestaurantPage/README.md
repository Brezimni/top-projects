# Project 03 - Restaurant Page

## Basic functionality

The goal 

- [ ] Project should be made using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) bundler.
- [ ] Add.gitignore to the root directory to explude *node_modules* and *dist* from being added to GitHub.
- [ ] DOM elements should be created using JavaScript but styling can be done in a separate CSS file.
- [ ] Project should be a SPA with tabs in the nabvar.
- [ ] Contents of each tab should be stored in a separate module. Each of these modules should export a function, that creates appropriate div.
- [ ] Index.js should contain tab switching logic that wipes the contents and loads them again using "*tab module*".
