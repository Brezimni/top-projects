# Project 03 - Restaurant Page

## Basic functionality

I've created a website according to TOP guidlines and inspired by [goodasfolk website] .

- [x] Project should be made using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) bundler.
- [x] Add.gitignore to the root directory to exclude *node_modules* and *dist* from being added to GitHub.
- [x] DOM elements should be created entirely using JavaScript but styling can be done in a separate CSS file.
- [x] Project should be a _SPA_ with tabs (__Home__, __Menu__ and __About__) in the nabvar.
- [x] Contents of each tab should be stored in a separate module. Each of these modules should export a function (in this case a _class object_), that returns an appropriate DOM element.
- [x] main.js should contain tab switching logic that wipes the contents and loads them again using "*tab modules*".

## Extra credits

- [x] Implement separation of concerns by storing content of the app in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
- [ ] Add full fledged reservation form that confirms the reservation when submitted.
- [ ] Website should be responsive.
